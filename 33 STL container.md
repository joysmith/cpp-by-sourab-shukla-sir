### container

- Container library is a collection of classes
- The container are implemented as generic class templates
- containers help us to implement and replicate simple and complex data structures & algorithm very easily like arrays, list, trees, associative arrays and many more
- containers can be used to hold different kind of objects like int, char, double, string, etc

### Common containers

- vector: replicates arrays
- queue: replicate queues
- stack: replicate stack
- priority_queue: replicates heaps
- list: replicate linked list
- set: replicates trees
- map: associative arrays

### classifications of containers

Sequence containers

- Like array, linked list etc

Associative containers

- Sorted data structure like map, set, etc

Unordered Associative structure

- Unsorted data structure

Containers Adapters

- Interfaces to sequence containers
