## History of C++

- Invented by Bjarne stroustrup
- ⬇️ put photo
- 1978-1979 launch
- AT & T bell labs
- C with classes
- 1983 C++

## Facts of C++

- C++ OOP was inspired by computer simulation language called Simula67
- JAVA is written in C++
- Major operating systems of modern times are written in C++
- C++ is world 4 most used programming language

## Features of C++

- C++ is a middle level language, means we can do low level programming(machine dependant coding- device drivers) and high level programming(application software- hardware independent coding)
- C++ support principle of Object oriented paradigm
- C++ joins three separate programming traditions

1. procedural language tradition, represent by C
1. object-oriented language tradition, represented by the class enhancements C++ adds to C
1. generic programming, supported by C++ templates

## Comparison between C and C++

- C++ is a super set of C language means we can use old features in C++ provided in C
- C++ programs can use existing C software libraries
- C follows top down approach of programming
- C++ follows bottom up approach of programming
- C adopts procedural oriented programming
- C++ adopts object oriented programming

## What is Object oriented programming

- OOPs is a programming approach which revolves around the concept of "Objects".
- Any entity in the system that can be defined as a set of properties and set of operations performed using entity's property set, is known as object
- 5 principle

1. Encapsulations
1. Data Hiding
1. Abstraction
1. Polymorphism
1. Inheritance

## Classes and Objects

- class is a blueprint of an object
- class is class a description of Object's property set and set of operations
- creating class is as good as defining a new data type
- class is a means to achieve encapsulation
- object is a run time entity
- object is an instance of a class

## Identifier

#### Constants

- any information is constant
- every software manage information
- data = information(name, song, photo, numbers) = constant
- types of constant

- secondary constant are made with the help of primary constant

#### variables

- variables are the names of memory locations where we store data
- variable name is any combinations of alphabet (a-z or A-Z), digit(0-9) and underscore(\_)
- valid variable name cannot start with digit

### Keywords or predefine words or reserved words

## Identifier Data types

- int: integer
- char: character
- float: real
- double: real
- void
