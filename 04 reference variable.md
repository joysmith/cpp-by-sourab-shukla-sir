### reference variable

- Reference means address
- Reference variable is an internal pointer
- Declaration of reference variable is preceded with '&' symbol (but do not read it as 'address of')
- Reference variable must be initialized during declaration
- It can be initialized with already declared variables only
- Reference variable can not be updated, means once you set reference of a variable it is set, can't be altered
